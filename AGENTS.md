# EHR Dashboard Development Log

This document tracks the development progress, key architectural decisions, and tasks completed for the EHR Dashboard project.

## Phase 1: Data Layer and Seeding (Completed)

**Objective**: Build the foundational data layer, including the database schema, migration, and seed data.
**Outcome**: The project has a fully functional and populated database, ready for backend and feature development.

## **Course Correction & New Plan (2025-10-06)**

**Feedback Received**: A code review highlighted that the previous work was incomplete. The backend was only partially built, and the frontend login page was implemented prematurely, against instructions.

**New Strategy**: The project is now undertaking a more rigorous and sequential development plan. The immediate and sole focus is to build the **entire** backend, creating service layers and API endpoints for **every model** in the Prisma schema. Frontend development, including the login page, will only commence after the backend is fully complete and verified.

## Phase 2: Complete Backend Implementation (In Progress)

**Objective**: Build a high-performance, maintainable backend with a clean service-layer architecture, covering all data models defined in the schema.

**Completed Sub-tasks**:
-   `Patient` Service & API
-   `Appointment` Service & API
-   `Task` Service & API

**Current Task**: Building the `MedicalHistory` service and corresponding API endpoints.

**Planned Backend Sub-tasks**:
1.  **Core Clinical Models**:
    -   [ ] `MedicalHistory`
    -   [ ] `ClinicalNote`
    -   [ ] `Encounter`
2.  **Detailed Patient Data Models**:
    -   [ ] `VitalSign`
    -   [ ] `Medication`
    -   [ ] `Allergy`
    -   [ ] `LabResult`
    -   [ ] `Procedure`
3.  **Operational & Communication Models**:
    -   [ ] `Department` & `Bed`
    -   [ ] `Conversation` & `Message`

## Phase 3: Authentication & Frontend Integration (Pending)

**Objective**: Implement a polished user authentication experience and connect the frontend to the now-complete backend services.
**Prerequisite**: Completion of all backend implementation tasks.
