# EHR Dashboard Development Log

This document tracks the development progress, key architectural decisions, and tasks completed for the EHR Dashboard project.

## Phase 1: Data Layer and Seeding (Completed)

**Objective**: Build the foundational data layer, including the database schema, migration, and seed data.

**Tasks Completed**:
-   **Prisma Schema**: Defined a comprehensive `schema.prisma` file, including models for `Profile`, `Patient`, `Appointment`, `MedicalHistory`, `ClinicalNote`, `Task`, and other related entities. The schema follows best practices for Supabase integration, using a `Profile` table linked to `auth.users`.
-   **Database Migration**: Generated and successfully applied the initial SQL migration to the Supabase database, creating the complete table structure.
-   **Seed Script**: Created a robust seed script (`prisma/seed.ts`) using `@faker-js/faker` to populate the database with realistic and varied sample data. This is crucial for development and testing.
-   **Dependencies**: Added `@faker-js/faker` and `ts-node` to support the seeding process.
-   **Tooling**: Added a `seed` script to `package.json` for easy database population.

**Outcome**: The project now has a fully functional and populated database, ready for backend and feature development.

## Phase 2: Authentication & Core Features (In Progress)

**Objective**: Implement user authentication and build out the core patient management functionality.

**Current Task**: Implementing user authentication with Google OAuth via Supabase.
